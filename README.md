# PatapClone

This is a Patap clone (http://patatap.com/). It was made purely for learning purposes. The app takes advantage of Paper.js for animations, as well as Howler.js for playing the various sounds. 

As of right now, the app has a dedicated sound for every letter key. If a user clicks on any other key, they will recieve an alert with telling them that there is no sound associated with that key. Also, each key is defined inside a "keyData" JS object that is prased through to determine the start color and sound for the key.
